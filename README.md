## 🌟 Context

> **Docker** is a platform that allows you to containerize your applications, making them portable and easy to run anywhere. Move your app from your laptop to a server without worrying about dependencies or configuration issues!

Containers are:

- 🧳 Self-contained
- ⚡ Lightweight & fast
- 🔄 Easy to scale
- 🛠️ Managed with orchestration tools like Docker Compose

## 🏗️ Project Overview

In this project, you will build an infrastructure with:

| Component        | Description                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| 🔀 Reverse Proxy | Routes traffic to services |
| ⚖️ Load Balancer | Distributes API requests   |
| 🖥️ API Servers   | Two application servers    |
| 🎨 Front-end     | Static-content server      |

---

## 🖼️ High-level Design

The entry point is a single server acting as:

- 🔀 **Reverse Proxy**: Routes traffic to API or front-end
- ⚖️ **Load Balancer**: Balances traffic between API servers (Round Robin)

### 🔄 Traffic Flow

**Front-end Requests**

> Routed to the front-end static-content server. Static content is returned to the proxy, then sent to the client. The client never talks directly to the front-end server.

**API Requests**

> Routed through a load-balancing algorithm (Round Robin) to one of the API servers. Response goes back to the proxy, then to the client. The client never talks directly to the API servers.

---

## ⚡ What is Round Robin Load Balancing?

Round Robin distributes traffic across servers in a rotating manner:

| Request | Server |
| ------- | ------ |
| 1       | A      |
| 2       | B      |
| 3       | C      |
| 4       | A      |
| ...     | ...    |

✅ Ensures equal share of traffic
✅ Prevents overload
❗ Simple & effective for learning purposes
